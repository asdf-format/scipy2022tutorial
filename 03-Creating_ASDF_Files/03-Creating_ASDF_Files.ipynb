    "ASDF files store their information using a tree structure. This allows the stored information be be\n",
    "hierarchically organized within the file. Without any extensions, this tree is a nested combination\n",
    "of basic data structures: maps, lists, arrays, strings, Booleans, and numbers. In Python these types\n",
    "correspond to `dict`, `list`, `np.ndarray`, `str`, `bool`, and `int`, `float`, `complex`. Where\n",
    "`np.ndarray` is treated in a special way. These data types can be extended to other types and objects\n",
    "using extensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the ASDF python library, this tree can be created using a Python dictionary using key/value pairs.\n",
    "Indeed, one can interact with any `AsdfFile` tree as if it were a dictionary. Note that due to limits\n",
    "imposed by Python, keys must be `bool`, `int`, or `str` types only, while data information can be any\n",
    "of the above data types.\n",
