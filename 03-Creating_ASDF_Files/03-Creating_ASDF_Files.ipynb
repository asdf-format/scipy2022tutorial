    "# 3 - Creating ASDF Files\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "ASDF files store their information using a tree (nested key/value) structure. This allows the stored\n",
    "information be be hierarchically organized within the file. Without any extensions, this tree is a\n",
    "nested combination of basic data structures:\n",
    "- maps,\n",
    "- lists,\n",
    "- arrays,\n",
    "- strings,\n",
    "- booleans,\n",
    "- and numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of which are stored using `yaml`. Note that more complex structures (ones not directly supported\n",
    "by `yaml`) are denoted using `yaml` tags. However, those tagged \"sub-trees\" are still comprised of the\n",
    "above basic structures and other tagged sub-trees. Additional tagged tagged objects are supported via\n",
    "ASDF extensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python analogs for these types are:\n",
    "- maps -> `dict`,\n",
    "- lists -> `list`,\n",
    "- arrays -> `np.ndarray`,\n",
    "- strings -> `str`,\n",
    "- booleans -> `bool`,\n",
    "- and numbers -> `int`, `float`, `complex` (depending on the type of number).\n",
    "\n",
    "Where `np.ndarray` are treated in a special way distinct from regular `yaml` (binary blocks). Note\n",
    "that due to limits imposed by Python, dictionary keys are limited to `bool`, `int`, or `str` types\n",
    "only, while value information can be any of the above data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, when creating an ASDF file using the python library, one begins by creating a nested Python\n",
    "dictionary which corresponds to the nested tree structure one wants the file to have. Indeed, one can\n",
    "interact with any `AsdfFile` object as if it were a dictionary representing this tree structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating ASDF files using basic python types\n",
